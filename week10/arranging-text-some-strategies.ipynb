    "Another method for arranging units of text is *permutation* and its close relative, *combination*. A permutation of a sequence of elements is *every possible arrangement* of those elements. You can also find every unique *combination* of a certain length of elements in a list. In permutation, the order of the elements matter (i.e., 'ABCD' and 'BACD' are different permutations of the characters in the string 'ABCD'), whereas in combinations, the order does not matter (i.e., 'ABC' and 'ACB' are both the same combination, since both share the same elements). I have a separate tutorial with [more information on permutations, combinations and randomness](https://github.com/aparrish/eroft/blob/master/randomness.ipynb) using Tarot cards as an example, if you're interested!\n",
