# 🧠 NLP Journey — Your Learning Path

## 1️⃣ Scraping HTML 🕸️  
We’ll start by **collecting real-world text data** from the web. Learning to scrape teaches you how to gather the raw materials you’ll use throughout the course.

## 2️⃣ Dealing with JSON 📂  
Once you’ve got your data, you’ll need to **clean and structure it**. JSON is everywhere — from APIs to datasets — so it’s a vital skill to master early on.

## 3️⃣ N-grams & Markov Chains 🔄  
Next, we’ll explore some **simple yet powerful algorithms** that predict text. This will introduce you to how machines can generate language *without diving into deep learning just yet*.

## 4️⃣ Understanding Word Vectors 🧩  
Here’s where it gets interesting. You’ll learn how modern models **represent words as numbers**. This concept — word embeddings — is the backbone of nearly all advanced NLP techniques. Plese stop running at cell with title **Finding the closest item**


## 5️⃣ Neural Network Text Prediction 🤖  
With word vectors under your belt, you’ll build your first **neural network for text prediction**. This is your introduction to deep learning applied to language.

## 6️⃣ Transformers Playground 🚀  
Finally, we’ll go into **state-of-the-art NLP**. By now, you’ll be ready to experiment with transformers — the models behind tools like ChatGPT and translation apps.

### 📝 Why this order?

- You’ll move **from data collection to advanced modelling**, just like in real-world NLP projects.
- Each step **builds on what you’ve already learned**, so hopefully it's not overwhelming.
- We’ll start with **hands-on, practical tasks** to keep things motivating, and finish by tackling the so called cutting edge.
