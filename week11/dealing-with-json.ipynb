    "# Dealing with JSON\n",
    "\n",
    "By [Allison Parrish](http://www.decontextualize.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a popular way of formatting data so that it can be shared between different computer systems. The idea is that you might have a data structure in one application, and you want to be able to send that data structure to another application. In order to do this, we need three things: (1) a common format that both applications understand (like JSON); (2) a way to take an in-memory data structure on the source machine and convert it to that format---this is called \"serialization\"; and (3) a way to change the \"serialized\" data back into an in-memory data structure on the target machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a library called `json` that does the work in (2) and (3) for us. The json library has two important functions: `dumps` (\"dump string\"), which converts a Python data structure to JSON, and `loads` (\"load string\") which converts a JSON string to a Python data structure. Here's an example:"

    "As you can see, the literal notation for Python objects (i.e., the way we write them in our programs) has a strong resemblance to the way that same data looks when encoded as JSON. There are a number of differences (i.e., JSON uses null instead of None; JSON always has double-quoted keys and values; escape sequences in JSON strings are very different from those in Python), but for the most part the formatted data should look very familiar. The json library can take pretty much any Python data structure and turn it into JSON---dictionaries, lists, ints, floats---even nested data structures, like dictionaries with lists as values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The great thing about JSON (as illustrated above) is that JSON-encoded data is just a string. I could copy this JSON data into an e-mail and send it to you, without having to worry about formatting, and you could paste it back into Python to get back the original data structure. (Or I could make a web application that encodes data structures as JSON, and you could read them with another computer program.)\n",

    "## JSON data from Corpora project\n",
    "\n",
    "JSON data is often made available as files with a `.json` extension. You can download these files and use them in your program. One good source of fun data in JSON format is Darius Kazemi's [Corpora project](https://github.com/dariusk/corpora/), which makes available an eclectic collection of \"static corpora (plural of 'corpus') that are potentially useful in the creation of weird internet stuff.\" For example, there's [a list of common English nouns](https://github.com/dariusk/corpora/blob/master/data/words/nouns.json), [a list of color names with corresponding RGB values](https://github.com/dariusk/corpora/blob/master/data/colors/xkcd.json), and even [a list of guitar manufacturers](https://github.com/dariusk/corpora/blob/master/data/music/a_list_of_guitar_manufacturers.json).\n",
    "\n",
    "These files are great sources for making experimental generative text projects. The simplest way to use one in your notebook is to download it from Github and put it in the same directory as your notebook file. To download one of the files, navigate to it in the repository (click on the `data` directory and navigate through the categories until you find something that looks interesting), then click on the button that reads \"Raw.\" This will show the JSON data directly in your browser, without the surrounding formatting of the Github web page. Then use your browser to save the file (usually `File > Save Page As...`). Save the file in the same directory as your notebook. You should see it pop up in Jupyter Notebook's `Home` tab.\n",
