    "## Why word vectors for poetry?\n",
    "\n",
    "Tzara proposed a method of composing a Dada poem: cut out the words of a text, shake them in a bag, then write down the words as you remove them at random from the bag. The very idea caused a riot and sundered the avant garde in twain (or so the story goes). For poets, word vectors are (for better or worse) a tool to help soften the blow of cut-up techniques: instead of selecting words at random, we might select units of text that are *close in meaning* to other units. This can yield poetic juxtapositions with subtle effects impossible to achieve with other techniques.\n",

The process of getting rid of superfluous dimensions in a vector space is called [dimensionality reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionality_reduction), and most implementations of count-based word vectors make use of dimensionality reduction so that the resulting vector space has a reasonable number of dimensions (say, 100—300, depending on the corpus and application).\n",

In the toy example above, we've said that a \"context\" is just the word that precedes and the word that follows. Depending on your implementation of this procedure, though, you might want a context with a bigger \"window\" (e.g., two words before and after), or a non-contiguous window (skip a word before and after the given word). You might exclude certain \"function\" words like \"the\" and \"of\" when determining a word's context, or you might [lemmatize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmatisation) the words before you begin your analysis, so two occurrences with different \"forms\" of the same word count as the same context.

Neither of these assertions are true, but (for better or worse) they reflect beliefs that many people hold about how language works. The fact that word vectors reflect these beliefs, in my opinion, makes text analysis and text generation based on word vectors more intuitive than  the alternatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "More recently, the task of finding semantic similarity between passages of text is accomplished using systems that operate not on words as units, but on units determined by unsupervised tokenization algorithms like [SentencePiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece). These systems often use neural network machine learning models (like [transformers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model))) to calculate vectors for words and longer stretches of text that take the surrounding textual context into account. These embeddings are often more accurate, at the cost of explainability and increased use of computational resources. Here are a few resources for learning more about this method:\n",
